Hello Unity Devs!
This is a "free" version of a new Audio Asset on the theme of Angels and Demons.
It will include a dozen fully interactive/adaptive soundtracks and a few awesome random music generators for Church! (baroque organs, choirs,...)

All tracks are in MP3/OGG format, 192kb/s quality.

In the meantime, you can already enjoy this free pack which includes standalone extracts and short loopable extracts from all of the pieces included inside my upcoming asset! 
Hope you'll enjoy them as much as I enjoyed composing them!
Let me know what you think!

Cheers!
Marma
